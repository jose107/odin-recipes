    <p>Good option for a day as special as Valentine's Day and for those of you who celebrate it and are still behind
        without knowing what to prepare, I bring you this recipe for cava and raspberry truffles, delicious! They are
        prepared in a short time and since they do not need much refrigeration time, they are the perfect option for
        last-minute rushes.</p>

    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dark chocolate 70% cacao 100G</li>
        <li>Liquid cream 80ML</li>
        <li>Cava 30ML</li>
        <li>Icing sugar 25G</li>
        <li>Butter 5G</li>
        <li>Dehydrated Raspberries 25G</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <p><strong>We heat the cream together with the sugar</strong> until it boils. In a bowl, chop the chocolate and pour the
        hot cream over
        it while stirring with a whisk so that the chocolate dissolves completely. We add the butter and the cava and mix
        completely.</p><br>
    <p><strong>Pour the mixture into a tray</strong>, add the raspberry, stir and refrigerate until the dough has hardened
        (the thinner the surface before it cools). Once we have the dough set, we make balls of equal size with a spoon and
        shape it into a perfect ball with our hands, being careful not to give too much heat to the dough.</p><br>
    <p>Finally, we coat each truffle in whatever we prefer: cocoa powder, shavings, anise balls, etc. We refrigerate until
        ready to eat in an airtight container or tupperware so that the chocolate does not become moist.</p>
